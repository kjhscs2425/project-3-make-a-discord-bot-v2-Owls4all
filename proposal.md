# Proposal
all the messages have to say the bot's name (Frost) to get a response. - even those that don't explicitly say it here (I got tired of typing it 7 billion times)

When a user says: Frost (and nothing else) #Implemented
My bot will respond by: That's me!

When a user says: Frost pick a number between 1 and 10 #Implemented
My bot will respond by: determined randomly, either i or e

When a user says: Frost pick an integer between 1 and 10 #Implemented
My bot will respond by: a random number between 1 and 10

When a user says: Frost are you a person #Implemented
My bot will respond by: no

When a user says: I like potatoes #Implemented
My bot will respond by: I like potatoes too

When a user says: do you like potatoes #Implemented
My bot will respond by: yes

When a user says: what time is it
My bot will respond by: time for you to get a watch

When a user says: let's play rock paper scissors! 
My bot will respond by: ok, what do you choose [set a variable: playing rock paper scissors:fair and choose a choice]

When a user says: either rock, paper, or scissors {when playing}
My bot will respond by: winning, losing, or playing fair depending on what state it's in

When a user says: Frost [something that isn't a known command] #Implemented
My bot will respond by: I don't know what that means

more stuff I want to add potentially:
- roll dice, like d&d, with description of outcome
-
